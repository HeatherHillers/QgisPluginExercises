# Qgis Plugin Exercises
This collection of QGIS Plugins is meant as a set of exercises for someone new to qgis plugins and qt.  They are meant to give a basic cookbook for QT Dialogs and the pyqgis API.  I've written about 30 plugins for my company, and these exercises include the features that I use the most in my plugins.  The collection is meant for onboarding new coworkers and I hope it will be of help to others wo are starting out with QGIS development.

## How to complete the lessons
Each directory contains a simple plugin with a user interface.  The directories are numbered. Work through them in order.  The first one is just your basic boilerplate plugin, and the examples build from there.  

For each directory:

  - Enter the directory and read the Readme.  
  - Read the description of the plugin.  Try to recreate the plugin as described.
  - in the solution directory you will find the finished plugin.  Compare my code to yours.
  - Read the discussion text, where I will add some comments to the plugin.
